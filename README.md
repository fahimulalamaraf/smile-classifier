# Smile Classifier

## Overview
The Smile Classifier is a machine learning project aimed at accurately detecting and classifying smiles in images. This project uses various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in smile detection.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models and checkpoints.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and preparing the image dataset.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for smile detection.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained models.
- **Deployment**: Instructions and scripts for deploying the model in a production environment.
